**Teaser:** The incredible life of *Epulopiscium *bacteria.

Across the tree of life, many organisms don't live by the typical 'rules’ of biology. One incredible group of rule-breakers are the giant *Epulopiscium *bacteria (pronounced eh-peu-loh-PIS-ee-uhm). These microbes can grow to a whopping 0.6 millimeters, which is pretty impressive in the bacterial world. For perspective, *E. coli*, a traditional example of a bacterial cell, is about 0.001 millimeters, and the largest human cell is the ovum, or egg cell, which is about 0.12 millimeters in size.

*Epulopiscium *are not only physical giants; they also have an enormous genome. While humans and most animals have only two sets of chromosomes (known as diploidy), *Epulopiscium *bacteria can have up to 400,000 sets of chromosomes (known as extreme polyploidy) [1]! Because mutations happen randomly, this bacteria's large genome size creates more opportunities for mutations to arise. Fortunately, the giant *Epulopiscium *genome is also protective, as having many copies of chromosomes allows for these mutations to accumulate in their DNA without causing fatal harm to the cell [1]. Even after experiencing many changes to their genetic blueprint, these bacteria can survive and pass down their mutations to the next generation [1]. 

These fantastic traits are likely tied to the bacteria's symbiotic lifestyle. *Epulopiscium *bacteria are only found in the guts of surgeonfish [2-3]. They were discovered in 1985 by a group of fish biologists looking at the gut contents of surgeonfish in the Red Sea, and, at the time, they thought *Epulopiscium *were too big to even be bacteria [4]. Since these bacteria have never survived in the lab, we have only ever studied them from dissections [5]. It's likely that their endosymbiotic ecology allowed them to evolve into such large, extremely polyploid bacteria [3].

The symbiotic lifestyle of *Epulopiscium *bacteria also likely contributes to their unique method of reproduction. Most bacteria, including *E. coli, *reproduce in a process called binary fission, where the cell elongates and splits down the middle into two daughter cells. Some bacteria reproduce differently through a process called sporulation, where vegetative, seed-like offspring develop into daughter cells. *Epulopiscium *bacteria reproduce in a fantastic version of sporulation -- their daughter cells develop inside the cell body of the mother cell and emerge in vivipary, or live birth [2; Figure 3].

Reproducing through vivipary requires dynamic genome structure and content. When forming daughter cells, the mother cell extrudes almost all of her tens of thousands of copies of DNA, leaving only a tiny fraction of her genetic material for the next generation to inherit [3]. Because they only delegate a small portion of their genome to their offspring, *Epulopiscium *are a unique bacterial version of a process called germline/soma distinction that is found among all eukaryotes (e.g. multicellular organisms) [6]. In this way, they are a kind of 'missing link.' They may be exhibiting an ancestral form of a genomic process essential to eukaryotic organisms alive today. 

Because of their unusual shape and lifecycle, *Epulopiscium *help expand our understanding of what it means to be a bacteria. Their impressive size, extreme polyploidy, and ability to give birth to live daughter cells provoke new questions about their evolutionary history and ecological roles. Rule-breaking microbes like *Epulopiscium *hold exciting secrets to life that we are only beginning to discover. That's big.
